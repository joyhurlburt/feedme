API Calls take an inconsistent amount of time to complete which affects the response time on the Meal Plan and Recipe views.

After selecting dietary preferences, user clicks on 'New Plan' to get a meal plan. The response time can take awhile for the recipe to load.

After the meal plan recipes have loaded, user can click on recipe name which opens the Recipe modal. Recipe info on this modal can take awhile to load.

The user can add, delete, and check ingredients on the Grocery List view.

Users can add photos from the photo library on the Photos view.
